# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you will need to setup a proper development environment. 

**You will need:**
1. React-Native
2. Android SDK (for android platform)
    - SDK version: 26
    - Build tools: 26.0.2
3. IOS - TBD

## External prerequisites
This application depends on several external services. To be able to successfully run this application, you will have to setup the following services:
### 1. Firebase 
You will need a Firebase project: https://console.firebase.google.com
### 2. Google Maps
TBD
### 3. Facebook
TBD

## Build and Run - Android device
### Cloning the Repository
    $ git clone https://github.com/makingwaves/MakingLunch 
    $ cd MakingLunch

### Install dependencies
    $ npm install
### APK Signing 
1. Create a keystore (under **MakingLunch\keystores** folder):

       $ mkdir .\keystores && cd .\keystores
       $ keytool -genkey -alias <key_alias> -keyalg RSA -keystore <keystore_file> -keysize 2048   
    The tool will ask you to provide keys store password, key password and some other information.

2. Signing configuration \
    The file `.\android\app\build.gradle` sets up signing configuration for the app. This file refers to an external file which is NOT checked into the git repository. The file is `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (windows: `c:\\users\\%username%\\.gradle\\gradle.properties`) on the machine used to build the app. The file contains information about where the keystore is located and what the password is. 
    
    Example gradle.properties file:
    
        MAKINGLUNCH_STORE_FILE=<keystore_file>
        MAKINGLUNCH_STORE_PASSWORD=<keystore_password>
        MAKINGLUNCH_KEY_ALIAS=<key_alias>
        MAKINGLUNCH_KEY_PASSWORD=<key_password>
    
     Keep in mind that it is strongly advised not to store this kind of information under a version control system. \
     You can read more about Generating Signed APK ans setting up gradle variables [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.59/signed-apk-android).


### Setup Firebase
 After a keystore and the provided <key_alias> key are successfully created, run following command to read the SHA1 fingerprint.

        $ keytool -list -v -keystore <keystore_file>
    
1. Add android application to Firebase with the name ```com.makingLunch``` and provide SHA1 fingerprint, obtained in step 1
2. Download generated google-services.json file from Firebase to **MakingLunch\android\app**

### Setup environment variables
Create a .env file in the MakingLunch directory: 

    API_URL=<backend server url>
    FACEBOOK_APP_ID=<facebook app id>
    GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=<google web client id>
    GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<google maps api key>
    PUSH_NOTIFICATION_SENDER_ID=<sender id> 

- **API_URL** - This is a URL to API service (backend). 
- **FACEBOOK_APP_ID** - This is a unique number that identifies app in facebook. It is needed for Facebook Login.
- **GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID** - This is a OAuth2.0 google client id created by Firebase. You can get it from Google Developers Console - it will be called like 'Web client (auto created by Google Service)'. Or alternatively you can read this value from google-services.json from property client.services.appinvite_service.other_platform_oauth_client.client_id\
- **GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY** - This is API key that you generate using the Google Cloud Platform Console. Each time you use Google Maps Platform products, you must include an API key to validate your request.
- **PUSH_NOTIFICATION_SENDER_ID** - This is FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) sender id. A unique numerical value created when you create your Firebase project.

### Build and run on Android device
The following command will build and install the application onto your Android device. Make sure that you have a device conned or a AVD running.

**Debug version:**

    $ react-native run-android

**Relese version:**

    $ react-native run-android --variant=relese

### Troubleshooting
1. **Unable to load script from assets index.android.bundle.** Error \
Make sure you did configure a reverse proxy on your device: e.g.

        $ adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081

2. Google login does not work.
    
    - Check if copied SHA1 key is correct
    - Check if application name is ```com.makingLunch```
    - Check the google-services.json file
    - Check if KEYSTORE_WEBCLIENT_ID is correct
    - Check if you configured google login screen (provide support email etc.)
